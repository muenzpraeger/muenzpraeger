# Hallo! Hello! ¬°hola! Salut! „ÇÑ„ÅÇ yƒÅ ![Waving hand](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muenzpraeger/muenzpraeger/main/assets/wave.gif)

Hey - I am Ren√© and I'm a builder of stuff and things.

You won't find a fancy list of the tech that I work with listed, as that can _and_ will change from day to day. Too many interests over the years. Browse around my repos if you like, and check out if you find something interesting. Or not.

There are two fun projects that I want to highlight:

- An ESLint plugin [for inclusive language](https://github.com/muenzpraeger/eslint-plugin-inclusive-language)
- A CLI to create [scaffolded Lightning Web Components projects](https://github.com/muenzpraeger/create-lwc-app)

You can find me [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muenzpraeger), in case you're interested in my professional vita. From time to time I blog, potentially, [here](https://blog.winkelmeyer.com/).

The _tl;dr_ is: Since the late 90s I love to combine technology with process and project management for solving business challenges. It's the narrow overlap of unifying the view of a technologist with the view of a business person which excites me.

It's all about building stuff, and sharing the resulting knowledge, to make others successful.

Also, I'm a German/Dutch. You have been warned. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
